# Project_Life_expectancy
Hello everyone, welcome to my site.
As you can see, this is built to store my datasets collecting from the internet about the project "What are key factors contributing to Life expectancy at birth".
All the datasets here are collected from the Internet. I have create a portfolio about this topic, and this is the dataset for the viewers of my site. They can come here to get the data sourece. This is encrypted and if you view my website, you absolutely get the key and then come to this site.
If you are the owner of the dataset and you do not want me to post your dataset here, please email me (jl2622@georgetown.edu). 
I am sorry for that inconvenience and remove them from my site ASAP!

Finally, hope you all enjoy the dataset I stored here.
